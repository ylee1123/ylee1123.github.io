My name is Yuna Lee. I want to share my ideas and paper reviews.
My research interest are 

- Low-shot Learning
- Data-Free Learning (DAFL)
- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
- and so on .... 

### My story

You can check my [CV]() in here (going to be updated - sorry, mate)
Since git blog isn't for sharing my pictures and hobbies, I advise you to go take a look at [my blog](https://dailyness.tistory.com/). There is nothing but pictures though.
